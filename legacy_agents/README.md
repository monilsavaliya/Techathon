# Legacy & Experimental Agents

This directory contains archived versions of agents and scripts developed during the initial phases of the project.

> **Note**: These files are **NOT** part of the main running application. For the production code, please see the `techathon_app/` directory.

## Structure
*   **`Agents/`**: Contains standalone scripts for:
    *   `pricing_Agent/`
    *   `sales_Agent/`
    *   `techincal_Agent/`

These components provided the foundation for the integrated system but are now kept here for reference and historical context.
